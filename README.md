# rPi-camera-demo
The program is a GUI application for raspberry pi high quality camera controls. 
The intent is to learn about GUI programming using GTK with C and that is why
I am not doing this using pre-existing python libraries for rPi camera.

Make sure you have GTK 2 installed, otherwise the code will not work. 
For windows WSL users make sure also have Xserver insalled for this to work.
Programmed on rPi 4 B using VSCode. Some testing is done on WSL.
